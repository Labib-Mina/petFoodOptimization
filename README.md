Title: FelineOpt

Description: 
Pet Food Optimizer is a C++-based Windows application that provides an intuitive graphical interface for evaluating and optimizing a pet’s daily nutritional intake. The program allows users to input their cat’s weight class, age, breed, and number of meals per day. It then calculates the pet’s ideal daily nutrient requirements—including protein and fat levels—based on scientifically informed dietary formulas.

Once the pet profile is entered, the software displays a detailed summary of the cat’s optimal intake and allows users to compare actual food products by entering nutritional values per meal. Using this information, Pet Food Optimizer computes a nutritional score and highlights the difference between the product’s composition and the pet’s dietary needs.

The interface features user-friendly input fields, optional dark mode support, and real-time calculations for adjusting fat and protein levels. Designed for clarity and accessibility, this program combines data-driven analysis with a simple GUI to help pet owners make informed feeding decisions.
